# Draconid Wars

Draconid Wars is a 2-player board game based on dice, with a theme loosely set around Dungeons & Dragons.

### The Story Behind the Game
18 years after the Second Draconid War, there has been a major outbreak of Draconem (Dragon) Pox among the Humanoid races. Humanoids speculate that after the mutual deaths of Humanoid Warlord Slaythurnax and Draconem Overlord Aldone in their climactic battle  in the Second Draconid War, the draconems had vanished but have now come back seeking revenge on all those responsible, and so has the virus they carried during the First Draconid War. A trio of a knight, wizard, and rogue have been commissioned to find out the remaining draconems and kill them, and on the other hand, three draconems have started on their journey to avenge their fallen Overlord. What happens when their paths cross is your and only your destiny to observe. Look excited young adventurers, for you all must not perish in this war!

### Instructions
  - The first player chooses a Humanoid character.
  - The second player chooses a Draconem character.
  - The Board appears, and Humanoid character begins by rolling a die!
  - The player moves ahead the same number of tiles as the number on the die.
    - If the player lands on their own tile, then their score is incremented by 2.
    - If the player lands on their opponent's tile, then their score is decremented by 1.
    - If the player lands on _Fields of Destiny_, they have an equal chance of winning a point or forfeiting a point.
    - If the player lands on _Mythic Kingdom of Friendship_ square, the player's score is not affected.
  - There is no clear winner in this game (just like there is no victor in war), and you can keep playing till one of the players reach an arbitrary limit on the score, decided before embarking on this quest. A game of 15 points is preferable for short playthroughs.
