### The Story Behind the Game

<p align="justify">19 years after the Second Dragon Crusade in Draconheim, there has been a major outbreak of Dragon Pox among the humanoid races. Humanoids speculate that after the mutual deaths of humanoid Warlord Slaythurnax and dragon Overlord Aldone in their climactic battle in the Second Dragon Crusade, the dragons had vanished but have now come back seeking revenge on all those responsible, and so has the virus they carried during the First Dragon Crusade. A trio of a knight, wizard, and rogue have been commissioned to find out the remaining dragons and kill them, and on the other hand, three dragons have started on their journey to avenge their fallen Overlord. What happens when their paths cross is your and only your destiny to observe. Look excited young adventurers, for you all must not perish in these perpetual crusades!</p>
